# MANAGE DATA

## Summary
Add a data entry to an account

## Description
Accounts are the backbone of Stellar applications and are part of any action you take on the network. One class of actions, and it's an important one, involves setting, modifying, or deleting data entries within an account's metadata. Data entries are key/value pairs and can be used to attach arbitrary, application-specific data to an account on the Stellar network. Each data entry increases the account's minimum balance by one base reserve (0.5 XLM).
