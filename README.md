# CREATE ACCOUNT

## Summary
Create an account on the Stellar network with the Go language

## Description
If Stellar were a universe, and it is, accounts would be the planets, stars, moons, and asteroids within that fertile space.

Less abstractly, accounts are the central data structure in Stellar â€” they hold balances, sign transactions, and issue assets. Accounts can only exist with a valid keypair and the required minimum balance of lumens (XLM).

In this quest, your challenge is to create an account by using the createAccount operation with the Quest Keypair located in the box on the right-hand side of this screen.
